Ability to manage FantasyGrounds.xml characters to generate complete and compact character sheet for easy printing for use during in person games.  Potentially have a mobile app that would allow the use and management of the character and then allow exporting of the data as FantasyGrounds.xml to be maintained in fantasy grounds.
